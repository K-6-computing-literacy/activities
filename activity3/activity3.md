# Activity 3: Different ways a computer sorts

## Description

Kids will learn about sorting by arranging numbered paper strips in order and using different sorting approaches that a computer can take.

## Grades

1st Grade onwards.

## Materials Required

- Paper pieces labelled 1-10
- Notebook & pen

## Steps to Conduct the Activity

### Step 1

- Using paper pieces, label them from 1 - 10
- Interact with students and ask why they thinking having things sorted and arranged can be useful.
- Explain the three different sorting methods we will be using (Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.)

### Step 2: How each sorting method works

#### Bubble Sort

- Bubble sort: Takes two adjacent pieces and compares them together and arranges them by swapping them if they are in the wrong order.
- Lay out the numbered paper strips in a random order.
- Find the smallest number among all the strips and move it to the first position.
- Find the next smallest number from the remaining strips and place it next to the first.
- Repeat

#### Selection Sort

- Selection Sort: repeatedly finding the smallest item in the unsorted part and moving it to the end of the sorted part.
- Selection Sort involves repeatedly finding the smallest item in the unsorted part and moving it to the end of the sorted part.
- Lay out the numbered paper strips in a random order.
- Find the smallest number among all the strips and move it to the first position.
- Find the next smallest number from the remaining strips and place it next to the first.
- Repeat till sorted

#### Insertion Sort

- Insertion sort: Insertion Sort involves sorted section one item at a time by comparing each new item with the items already sorted and inserting it in the correct position.
- Lay out the numbered paper strips in a random order.
- Start with the second strip and compare it to the first. Insert it in the correct position (before or after the first strip).
- Take the third strip and compare it to the already sorted strips, inserting it in the correct position.
- Repeat the process until all strips are sorted.

## Reflection

- Gather back as a class and ask students which method took them the least amount of time to do?
- If the answers vary, ask them why they felt that way?

Answers on which algorithm is usually faster:

- Bubble Sort: Slow because it has to compare and swap a lot.
- Selection Sort: A little better than bubble sort but still has to make many comparisons.
- Insertion Sort: Often the fastest of the three for small lists because it finds the right spot for each item without many unnecessary moves.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this activity, students should:

- Understand the basic concepts of sorting and why it is useful.
- Learn how to perform Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, and Insertion Sort.
- Recognize the differences in efficiency between the three sorting methods.
