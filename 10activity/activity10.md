## Steps to conduct the activity

### Step 1: Internet Safety Video 

- Ask students if they have ever used the internet and things they have done on the internet 

- Tell students "it is important to learn about the safest ways to use the internet" after going around and asking things they have done on the internet

- Ask what they learned from the video 

### Step 2: Flashcards

- Seperate groups into two and give flashcards that contain safe and unsafe terms. 

- Tell students to seperate safe from usafe flashcards and notify you when done 

- Check over flashcards before allowing them to move onto next step

### Step 3: Making Routes

- Students must use wooden blocks and flashcards to create two routes, safe and unsafe terms, for their spehro can go through 

Modification: Because Kindergarteners will have a harder time identifying terms, their activity stops with creating routes. 

### Step 4: Spheros

- Allow students to use spehro to run through their routes, once completed encouraged them to create new routes for their spehros to go through. 


## Reflection

- Reflection should be done after video is shown 

- As stated in the steps make sure to ask them what they learned from the video. Fllow this up by asking what they may do diffrently on the internet after watching the video. 


## Summary

Students should leave having a better understading of how they should navigate the internet. It is important to keep in mind that using the internet is nothing new for a majority of students, so it is important to ask them what they have done and identifying actions that may need to be changed.
