# Activity 9: Maze Navigation Activity

## Description

Introduce students to computational thinking by having them guide a "robot" through a maze using basic commands. This activity helps students develop skills in problem-solving, pattern recognition, and algorithmic thinking.

## Grades & Time Required

**Grades**: Kindegarden and beyond (Adaptable Complexity)
**Duration**: 30 - 40 minutes

## Materials Required

- A printed or drawn maze on paper
- A small car figure
- A set of command cards (e.g., move forward, turn left, turn right)

## Activity Steps

### Introduction

- Explain the concept of computational thinking and how it involves breaking down problems into manageable steps, recognizing patterns, and creating algorithms to solve problems.
- Introduce the maze and the goal: to navigate the robot from the start to the finish.

## Step 2: Maze

- Provide each student or group with a maze, a robot token, and command cards.
- Show the starting position and the goal on the maze.

## Step 3: Planning the Route

- Ask students to analyze the maze and plan a route for the robot.
- Encourage them to use the command cards to create a sequence of instructions that will guide the robot through the maze.
- Make students lay the sequence of commands in order.

### Step 4: Executing the Plan

- Students place their robot token at the starting position.
- They follow their planned sequence of commands to navigate the robot through the maze.
- If the robot encounters an obstacle or reaches a dead end, students should revise their plan and try again.

## Extension: Blockly Maze Game

Once students have successfully completed the maze activity, they can advance to a more challenging and interactive coding game using an iPad, such as the  [Blockly Maze Game](https://blockly.games/maze?lang=en)

## Reflection

After the activity has been concluded, gather students into a group and reflect on these questions:

- What challenges did you face?
- How did you solve any problems that arose?
- What strategies helped you find the correct path?
- Discuss how this activity relates to real-world computational thinking and problem-solving.

## Learning Outcomes

- Develop computational thinking skills through planning and executing a sequence of steps.
- Enhance problem-solving abilities by identifying patterns and applying appropriate strategies.
