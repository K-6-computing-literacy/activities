# Activity 5: Debuging 

## Description

- This activity is meant to teach students about what debugging is and the different ways bugs present themselves in code. The lesson will consist of activities that help identify when there is a bug present, how to fix it and the difference between syntax errors and logic errors. It is important to the lesson to emphasize what each example being used is supposed to represent. 

## Materials required

- Debugging Scenarios 
- Pencil 
- Paper 

## Steps to conduct the activity

### Step 1: Identifying Bugs

- Explain what the definition of a bug is in code and show an example of one through given scenarios. Make sure given scenarios are instructions for different tasks and have no actual lines of code in them.
- Distribute given scenarios for students to identify which statements need debugging. Make sure students identify and fix all bugs present in the instructions.

### Step 2: Categorizing Bugs 

- Explain what a syntax error is and what a logic error is and what knowing the difference tells us. Within the context of the activity, Syntax errors are mistakes that prevent the instructions from being done while logic errors can execute the instructions but not in the intended way.
- Give students more scenarios that now require them to identify if there is a bug present and whether the bug is syntax or logic.

### Step 3: Practice

- Require the students to create instructions that consist of mistakes, no mistakes, syntax errors and logic errors
- Doing this will help improve their understanding of how to identify bugs and the different types you can encounter

## Reflection

- Explain to them the similarity of actual code to our project, that being how debugging requires you to use the skills present in the activity. 
- Ask them if they found the activity challenging and something new they learned from the lesson
- Ask them which was harder, identifying bugs or categorizing them

## Summary

- This activity exposes students to the basics of debugging. It shows them the most common found errors in code and the ways we should deal with them. Engagement in these types of activities can better help students who are introduced to code, they will have better understanding of how to deal with errors when coding.
