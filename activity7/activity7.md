# Pattern Recognition Activity: "Pattern Detectives"

## Objectives

Children will identify, analyze, and create simple patterns using shapes, colors, or numbers.

## Grades & Time Required

**Grades**: 1st grade onwards.
**Time Required**: 1 hour

## Materials Needed

- Paper and colored pencils/crayons
- Pattern blocks or cut-out shapes
- Optional: A whiteboard and markers

## Instructions

### Step 1: Introduction to Patterns

- Start with a brief discussion about patterns. Explain that patterns are things that repeat in a certain order.
- Show a few simple examples of patterns using shapes and colors:
  - Shapes: ⬛⬛🔴⬛⬛🔴… (Two squares, one circle, repeat)
  - Colors: 🔵🟢🔵🟢🔵… (Blue, green, repeat)
  - Numbers: 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2… (Alternating 1 and 2)

### Step 2: Identify the Pattern

- Provide students with sets of simple sequences and ask them to identify the pattern. Examples:
  - Shapes: 🔺🔺⚫️🔺🔺⚫️…
  - Colors: 🟡🟡🟠🟡🟡🟠…
  - Numbers: 3, 3, 6, 3, 3, 6…

### Step 3: Extend the Pattern

- Once the students identify the pattern, ask them to continue the sequence by adding the next few elements.
  - Example: Sequence: 🔵🔵🟢🔵🔵🟢… (They add 🔵🔵🟢 next)

### Step 4: Create Your Own Pattern

- Ask students to create their own simple patterns using shapes, colors, or numbers on paper.
- Encourage them to share their patterns with a partner and see if their partner can identify and extend the pattern.

### Step 5: Pattern Puzzles

- Create a few "pattern puzzles" where some elements in the sequence are missing, and ask students to fill in the blanks.
  - Example: Sequence: 🟣, 🟣, 🟤, ___, 🟣, 🟣, 🟤, ___ (They fill in with 🟣, 🟣, 🟤)

### Extensions

Students who are able to complete the above exercises will be prompted to try the coding exercise on blockly called [Blockly Turtle](https://blockly.games/turtle?lang=en). This is a program which prompts them to try and code shapes.

## Reflection

Have students display the patterns and share them with the class. This allows them to take pride in their work and see the diversity of patterns created by their peers.

After completing the work with Blockly Turtle, ask students what they found the most tricky with the problems/levels in the website and how they overcame their struggles with figuring out the code.

## Learning Outcomes

- Students will develop the ability to recognize and extend patterns.
- Students will enhance their critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
- Students will learn to create their own patterns and share them with others.
