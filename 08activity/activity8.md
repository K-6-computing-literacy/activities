### Activity 7: Designing and Programming Robots

**Objective:** This activity aims to encourage students to reflect on their experiences with robots at the summer camp, foster creativity through drawing, and develop critical thinking skills through an engaging online coding exercise.

**Ages:**

- Can be from ages 4-11.

**Materials Needed:**

- Paper and pencils for drawing.
- Computers or tablets with internet access for the online activity.

**Instructions:**

1. **Reflection and Observation:**
   - Begin by giving each student a piece of paper.
   - Ask them to reflect on everything they observed about robots during their time at the camp. This includes components like distance sensors, speakers, and cameras.
   - Encourage them to list as many features and details as they can remember.

2. **Creative Drawing:**
   - Using their reflections, students will draw their own robot.
   - This drawing session is an opportunity for students to express their creativity and apply what they have learned about the various parts and functions of robots.

3. **Online Coding Activity - RodoCode:**
   - After the drawing session, introduce students to the online activity called RodoCode on Code.org.
   - RodoCode is a fun and interactive coding exercise where students use blocks to program a robot to reach its destination.
   - This activity is designed to enhance critical thinking and problem-solving skills.
