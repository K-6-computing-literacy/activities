# Guide for Computing Outreach Fellows

## What is the Computing Outreach Program?

Computing outreach involves engaging K-6 students in regular, hands-on computing activities to foster interest and competency in computational skills. This includes introducing students to computational thinking and problem-solving through events, workshops, and classroom activities, and using technologies. The goal is to provide consistent exposure in the computing field in a fun way.
