# Activity 4: Bee Bots 

## Description

In this activity the students main goal will be creating obstacles through conditional actions. Using the app for Bee Bot, students will be paired with one another and create routes that require block coding to move. Block coding is a hands-on way for children to learn the basics of coding. An activity that requires them to think about creating conditions for block coding will help them gain a better understanding of code and the creative ways you can use it.

## Grades & Time Required

**Kindergarten**: 45 min 

**2nd - 4th**: 30 min 

**5th & 6th**: 25min 

## Materials required

- Bee Bot 
- Pencil 
- Paper 
- Bee Bot Map (optional)

## Steps to conduct the activity

### Step 1: Forming Groups 

- The activity can be done by either putting individuals against one another or putting groups of students against each other.
- I would suggest starting off with individual competition in order to get all the students to practice creating routes without the help of others. It will better improve their skills in understanding the game
- I suggest trying groups once students have tried doing it on their own. Group participation is important to foster collaboration in this activity and should be present at some point in the activity.

### Step 2: Creating Routes and Conditions

- Encourage students to play around with Bee Bot to see the different blocks available to them
- Explain that you want them to create a route but to think of rules that they must abide too before creating the routes. Examples being the absence of blocks that makes Bee Bot go backwards. It also helps to make them think about the categorization of the blocks available to them, this will help improve the conditions they create.
- On a separate sheet of paper tell them to write down the rules they have created in a format that tells the opposing team what they are not allowed to do.

### Step 3: Completing Routes 

- Once students have created conditions and switched with their partners, start timing the students to see who creates a route first. You can have different rounds by switching out who the students are trading with.
- No conversation or collaboration from opposing teams should happen, only those who belong to the same group.
- If a student is having trouble with the activity, assist in showing some of the first steps needed for them to be successful.

## Reflection

- Explore with students how easy or hard they found the activity
- Ask the students what they found were the hardest conditions to abide by.
- Ask them if there were any conditions they tried making but weren't able to.

## Summary

- Participation in the activity is meant to improve students computational thinking. Block coding helps students get a better understanding of how coding works and can help them improve their skills in programming. Encouraging students to create and solve obstacles for block coding will greatly improve their coding skills.
